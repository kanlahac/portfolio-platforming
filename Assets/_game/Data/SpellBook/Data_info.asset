    Title: Scriptable objects
    Text: I use ScriptableObjects for data management, event systems, and more. I
      can create connections between scripts without direct dependencies.
  Right:
    Title: Structs
    Text: I like to use structs to create data structures. This way, I keep data
      grouped regardless of its type, which is excellent for use with lists.
